# This is a 2-repo project

This project includes a a React frontend, Flask backend, ElephantSQL database,  NASA API, and Stripe payment processing system.

You are currently in the Flask backend repo. If you haven't already, please click into my [Frontend](https://github.com/devcodus/react_eshop) to download it.

## How to spin up this Backend

In the project directory, you can run:

### `python3 -m venv my_venv` in order to instantiate a virtual environment

## then, if on a mac:
### run `source my_venv/bin/activate`
### next run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
### finally run `flask run`

## if on a pc:
### first go to the requirements.txt file and replace psycopg2-binary==2.9.5 with psycopg2==2.9.5
### then run `my_venv/scripts/activate`
### next run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
### finally run `flask run`



My eShop will only display properly if you have downloaded my [frontend](https://github.com/devcodus/react_eshop) and followed the instructions there to spin up the frontend. 

Happy Shopping!
